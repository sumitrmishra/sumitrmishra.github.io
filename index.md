    I&#39;m an Assistant Professor of Economics at the <a href="https://krea.edu.in/ifmrgsb/">Institute for Financial Management and Research, Sri City</a>. I am also an independent researcher and a research assistant to Professor Naila.

    I received my PhD in Development Studies, and M.Sc. in Economics from <a href="https://www.igidr.ac.in">Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research</a>. My thesis looked into the issue of regional imbalances in Maharashtra. I show that the constitutional mandate in form of the Article 371(2) did not ameliorate regional differences in the state.

My current research examines four aspects of Indian economic development:

-  The relationship between caste diversity and access to public goods in villages.
- The association between colonial land institutions and economic outcomes in villages. 
-  The association between segregation and public goods in cities.
- The movement from farm to non-farm occupations (_structural transformation_).
